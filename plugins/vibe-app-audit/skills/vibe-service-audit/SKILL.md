description: Audit a vibe-coded backend service, integration, ingestion job, or webhook handler against a category-specific security checklist and produce a markdown report with severity-tagged findings. Use when the user wants to security-review a non-user-facing service — a Stripe/GitHub/Shopify webhook handler, a data-ingestion job, a scheduled cron, an internal API, an API-to-API integration. Phrases like "audit my Stripe webhook handler," "review my ingestion job," "is my integration secure," "check this webhook receiver," or "audit this Lambda" all qualify. Covers webhook signature verification, API key / OAuth token handling, outbound-call safety, data egress, idempotency / replay protection, and job authentication, on top of the shared baseline (secrets, SAST, deps, monitoring). Runs safe live probes against a webhook or API base URL (unsigned / tampered / replayed / malformed payloads) and asks before any intrusive probe.

# Vibe-coded backend service security audit

This skill audits a backend service / integration / webhook handler — the kind of repo people
vibe-code when they want to glue Stripe to their database, run a daily ingestion job, or stand up
a webhook receiver. No UI, no browser threat model. The dominant failure modes are different
from a webapp: missing or wrong signature verification, replay attacks, secret handling in
outbound calls, and error messages that leak internals.

## When to use this skill

Use this when the user wants to security-review a service with no user-facing UI. Examples:

- Stripe / Shopify / GitHub webhook receivers.
- Data ingestion jobs (cron, scheduled GitHub Actions, Vercel cron, Lambda).
- API-to-API glue (Salesforce → Postgres, HubSpot → Segment, etc.).
- Internal APIs called by other services, not by browsers.

Don't use this for: user-facing web apps (use `vibe-webapp-audit`), chat bots that handle
platform events (use `vibe-bot-audit`), manual scripts (use `vibe-script-audit`), or MCP servers
/ AI agents (use `vibe-mcp-agent-audit`).

## Inputs the skill expects

- A path to a local repo (the working directory by default).
- Optionally, a **webhook URL or API base URL** — required for live probes (signature checks,
  replay rejection, malformed payloads).
- Optionally, sample valid request signatures or shared secrets, if the user wants the live
  tests to also exercise the _signed_ path.

Ask the user for the runtime target at the start. If they don't provide one, skip live tests
and note this in the report.

## Workflow

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-${SKILL_DIR}}"
SHARED_DIR="$SKILL_DIR/../../shared"
# Always reads:
#   $SHARED_DIR/references/baseline.md
#   $SHARED_DIR/references/live-tests-baseline.md
#   $SHARED_DIR/references/report-template.md
# Conditionally:
#   $SKILL_DIR/references/webhook-verification.md  (if any webhook endpoint found)
#   $SKILL_DIR/references/live-tests.md            (if a live target is provided)
```

1. **Detect the stack and runtime shape** (~30s — see below).
2. **Ask for the live target** (webhook URL, API base URL). Record what the user gave you.
3. **Run the baseline** (`$SHARED_DIR/references/baseline.md`, checks A–D).
4. **Run the category-specific static checks** (sections 1–6 below).
5. **Run live tests** if a target was provided. Read `$SHARED_DIR/references/live-tests-baseline.md`
   then `$SKILL_DIR/references/live-tests.md`.
6. **Render the report** using `$SHARED_DIR/references/report-template.md`.

### Detect the runtime shape

```bash
ls package.json pyproject.toml requirements.txt Gemfile go.mod 2>/dev/null
[ -f package.json ] && head -50 package.json

# Server frameworks
grep -hE "(express|fastify|hono|koa|next|fastapi|flask|django|sanic)" \
  package.json pyproject.toml requirements.txt 2>/dev/null

# Webhook endpoints
find . -path ./node_modules -prune -o \
  \( -path "*/webhooks/*" -o -path "*/webhook/*" -o -name "*webhook*" \) \
  -print | head -20

# Scheduled jobs
ls .github/workflows vercel.json fly.toml render.yaml 2>/dev/null
grep -lE "schedule:|crons|cron:" .github/workflows/*.yml vercel.json 2>/dev/null

# Outbound HTTP clients
grep -hE "(axios|got|node-fetch|undici|requests|httpx|aiohttp)" \
  package.json pyproject.toml requirements.txt 2>/dev/null
```

## 1 — Webhook signature verification

For every webhook endpoint, the handler MUST verify a signature header before reading the body.

- **At least one webhook endpoint found** → **MANDATORY: read
  `$SKILL_DIR/references/webhook-verification.md` in full before flagging anything in this
  section.** Covers HMAC, JWS, and platform-specific patterns (Stripe, GitHub, Shopify, Square,
  Twilio).
- **No webhook endpoint found** (pure ingestion / scheduled-job service) → Do NOT load
  `webhook-verification.md`. Skip this section and continue.

**Before flagging a webhook handler, ask yourself**: does the verification _gate_ the action,
or does it run alongside it? A handler that checks the signature but writes to the DB inside a
`try` that catches the verification error is unverified in practice. Walk the control flow from
request entry to first side effect.

Failure modes to flag:

- No signature check at all. **Critical**.
- Signature checked AFTER the body is parsed and acted on. **Critical** (the signature only
  helps if it gates the action).
- Signature check uses a non-constant-time comparison (`===` instead of `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
  / `hmac.compare_digest`). **High** (timing oracle).
- Signature secret is hardcoded or in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / similar. **Critical**.
- Custom signature scheme (rolling your own HMAC framing). **High** unless reviewed carefully.
- No timestamp check → infinite replay window. **High**.
- Timestamp check window > 15 min. **Medium**.

## 2 — API key and OAuth token handling

**The failure mode**: a credential the service holds for a third-party API ends up readable
from an unexpected source — a committed config file, a log line, a world-readable token cache,
or an OAuth refresh that hands back a long-lived access token nobody rotates.

**Before flagging, ask yourself**: if this credential leaked, what's the blast radius? A Stripe
restricted key with one-resource scope is different from a Stripe live key with full account
access. Severity tracks scope, not just exposure.

**Patterns to flag**:

| Pattern                                                                  | Severity     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| API key read from a non-env source (hardcoded, JSON-in-repo, unauth URL) | **Critical** |
| Tokens written to a world-readable file (mode 0644 or wider)             | **High**     |
| Tokens logged on success or failure handlers                             | **High**     |
| OAuth refresh tokens stored alongside access tokens with no rotation     | **Medium**   |
| OAuth scopes broader than the service needs                              | **Medium**   |

**Find the surface**:

```bash
grep -rE "process\.env\.|os\.environ\." --include="*.{ts,js,py}" . | head -30
grep -rE "(writeFile|fs\.write|open\(.*['\"]w)" --include="*.{ts,js,py}" . | grep -iE "token|key|secret" | head -10
grep -rE "refresh_token|refreshToken" --include="*.{ts,js,py}" . | head -10
```

## 3 — Outbound calls

**Before flagging an outbound call, ask yourself**: is the _credential_ being sent over a
verified channel? TLS verification disabled means the bearer token, basic-auth header, or API
key in the request is readable by any network attacker on the path. The severity isn't "TLS is
broken" — it's "the secret you're sending is now public to anyone in the middle."

**Patterns to flag:**

| Pattern                                                                 | Severity                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TLS verification disabled (`verify=False`, `rejectUnauthorized: false`) | **Critical** in production code paths; **Low** in clearly-marked test fixtures |
| Cleartext HTTP for any third-party API that carries auth headers        | **High**                                                                       |
| Error message from outbound call echoed verbatim to client / logs       | **High** — these often contain the request including the API key               |

**Find the surface:**

```bash
grep -rE "(rejectUnauthorized: false|verify=False|ssl=False|InsecureSkipVerify)" \
  --include="*.{ts,js,py,go}" . | head -10

grep -rE "http://(?!localhost|127\.)" --include="*.{ts,js,py,env*}" . | head -10
```

## 4 — Data egress

**Before flagging a data-egress finding, ask yourself**: where does this data _actually_ end
up? `logger.info(req.body)` and `analytics.track(payload)` are both "egress" but with different
consumers and retention. A request body in a server log retained 30 days is **High**; the same
data in a customer-facing email is **Critical**.

**Patterns to flag:**

| Pattern                                                                | Severity   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Raw request body or response logged in production                      | **High**   |
| PII forwarded to a third-party (analytics, errors, AI) without DPA ref | **Medium** |
| Secrets/tokens accidentally included in error captures (Sentry et al.) | **High**   |

**Find the surface:**

```bash
grep -rE "(console\.log|logger\.(info|debug)|print\().*\b(body|payload|data|request|response)\b" \
  --include="*.{ts,js,py}" . | head -20
grep -rE "(email|phone|ssn|password|token|api_key)" --include="*.{ts,js,py}" . | head -20
```

## 5 — Idempotency and replay safety

**Before flagging an idempotency gap, ask yourself**: is this handler _naturally_ idempotent
(e.g., upserts a key with a deterministic value) or does it produce duplicates on every retry
(e.g., appends a row, sends an email, charges a card)? Platforms retry deliveries; without
idempotency, a single user event can become 5 charges, 5 emails, 5 rows. Severity tracks the
visible-to-users impact of duplication.

Webhook receivers and event handlers must be safe to receive the same event twice.

- Look for an idempotency-key lookup before performing the action.
- Look for a check on a unique event/delivery ID (Stripe `event.id`, GitHub `X-GitHub-Delivery`).
- Flag handlers that perform side effects (charge a card, send an email) before recording the
  delivery ID.

**Severity:** Handler with side effects and no idempotency: **High**. Critical if the side
effect is a payment, an email to a user, or a row-write that can't be rolled back.

## 6 — Job and scheduled-trigger authentication

**Before flagging a cron handler, ask yourself**: how is the scheduler _talking_ to this code?
Vercel cron hits an HTTP endpoint on your deployment with an `Authorization` header from
`CRON_SECRET`. GitHub Actions invokes a workflow with its own auth. Lambda+EventBridge fires
events through IAM. The scheduler-to-handler edge is what needs auth; an unauthenticated HTTP
endpoint that just _happens_ to be the cron target is a backdoor anyone with the URL can
trigger.

For cron jobs / scheduled tasks (GitHub Actions, Vercel cron, Render cron, Lambda+EventBridge):

- If the scheduled endpoint is reachable from the public internet, it must check a shared secret
  or signed header from the scheduler.
- A scheduled route that's also a public POST endpoint with no auth is a backdoor: anyone can
  trigger the job.

Look for `CRON_SECRET`, `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, or platform-specific scheduler headers
in the handler. Missing: **High**.

## Producing the report

Read `$SHARED_DIR/references/report-template.md`. Save the report to the working directory as
`vibe-service-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.md`. Tell the user the exact path.

## What this skill is NOT

- Not a replacement for SAST/DAST/SCA tooling. It catches the common vibe-coded-service failure
  modes.
- Not a pen test. The live tests probe specific known failure modes (signature, replay,
  malformed); they don't fuzz the application.
- Not a code review. Code quality, performance, and architecture issues are out of scope.
